# This file is for John Neal's Mini Project 3 for EC601 at Boston University.

# You can read more indepth about the project in main_mysql.py (the main for the MySQL implementation of Mini Project 3) and main_mongo.py (the main for the MongoDB implementation of Mini Project 3)

# Currently the only query run is one that matches the number of instances of any tag appearing in Twitter API accesses.

# Future Developments:

	- updated documentation explaining the database impementation functions (especially when another user needs to enter own credentials)
	- a script to populate the databases with more entries, because adding entries by hand just isn't fun :( and the magic only happens when you have tons of random data
