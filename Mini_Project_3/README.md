# This file is for John Neal's Mini Project 3 for EC601 at Boston University.

# You can read more indepth about the project in main_mysql.py (the main for the MySQL implementation of Mini Project 3) and main_mongo.py (the main for the MongoDB implementation of Mini Project 3)

# Still need to implement:

-	Search for certain words and retrieve which user/session that has this work in it.  For example, search for ‘basketball”, and get results of which user had Basketball in their sessions.

-	Collective statistics about overall usage of the system.  For example
  •	Number of images per feed
  •	Most popular descriptors
